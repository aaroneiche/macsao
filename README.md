# Mac SAO 

The Mac SAO is a simple add-on I've built heading into Hackaday Supercon 2024. It is a celebration of the original Macintosh, which debuted 40 years ago in 1984. 

In the spirit of Open source and good faith hardware hacking, all of the code here is open to use. If you do so, I would love to know.
